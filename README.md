# Scripts

This collection of scripts is meant to demonstrate my scripting ability. They will not run to completion without being on the correct platform with specific libraries. 

The shell scripts set up environment variables, and call various python scripts which perform process mapping and performance testing of Microbenchmarks and the Hoomd-blue HPC application.
